I've started learning React so I tried to work around with rendering and using 3d models in webpages.
Please note that this is NOT AT ALL RESPONSIVE, and all alignment values and sizes have been set in accordance to my display, so you will have to alter the sizes and other properties according to YOUR display if you're running this on your rig!
